  It was helpful to install [numba-cuda](https://github.com/kf-cuanschutz/NVIDIA_Grace_Hopper_benchmarking_logs_/blob/main/Daily_installs_loggings/Log_May_30th%26Jun_4th_kf_.md) but also, [Rapids](https://github.com/kf-cuanschutz/NVIDIA_Grace_Hopper_benchmarking_logs_/blob/main/Daily_installs_loggings/Log_June25th_kf.md) , cupy or [ccc](https://github.com/greenelab/ccc) and many more!! [Horovod](https://github.com/kf-cuanschutz/NVIDIA_Grace_Hopper_benchmarking_logs_/blob/main/Daily_installs_loggings/Log_Jun20th_kf.md) installation failed with miniconda unfortunately.
