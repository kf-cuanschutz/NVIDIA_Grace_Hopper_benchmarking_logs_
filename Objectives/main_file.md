Objectives:
===========

(1) Benchmark NVIDIA [Pararabricks](https://github.com/kf-cuanschutz/CU-Anschutz-HPC-documentation/blob/main/Workshops/nvidia_workshop_series_information_spring_23.md), as this has not been done before 
and it would be a great advancement for Anschutz Medical Campus.

(2) Benchmark Hopper 2 raw speed and throughput

(3) Demonstrate and document software installation

(4) Benchmark Horovod on both the CPU and the GPU side.

(5) Benchmark Alphafold and Fragfold.

(6) Benchmark the Pi example. If possible use OpenMP as well.

(7) Test orchestrators: kubernetes, docker swarm, slurm, sparkcluster etc ...

(8) Benchmark LLMs

(9) Benchmark Machine learning with NVIDIA [Rapids](https://developer.nvidia.com/rapids/get-started).

(10) Benchmark the game of Life pipeline

(12) Benchmark AMFM texture extraction methods

(13) Benchmark MRI reconstruction pipelines.

(14) Benchmark with HPL-gpu

(15) Benchmark Deep learning using Hands-on Machine learning github [examples](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml3/tree/main) and MarkIII Sys workshop series [1](https://trending.markiiisys.com/cu-anschutz-aiseries), [2](https://trending.markiiisys.com/cu-anschutz-ai-2024), [3](https://github.com/kf-cuanschutz/CU-Anschutz-HPC-documentation/blob/main/Workshops/nvidia_workshop_series_information_spring_23.md).

(16) Ensure that on Grace Hopper we can recreate a Research Computing like environment. That is, an environment where researchers can run their experiments without too many hurdles and provided that they have access to a well written documentation.
